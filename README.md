# Peripheral-Driver

In this section, I built the peripheral GPIOs driver including interrupt Handling from scratch. 
This includes writing header containing relevent addresses and source file for initialization function and finally main.c file (as application level code in-order to test/implement the driver code).

**Hardware specification:**
- STm32F411VE Discovery board.
- STM32 ARM M3-Cortex series.
- 32 bit Microcontroller.

This code is written considering the industrial standards with proper documentation, do check it.

**Also please note this driver code is limited to GPIO peripheral, RCC clock and GPIO Interrupt configuration.**
